<h1>King of Spinney Castle</h1>
<i>2021</i>

<p>On the hill of my home on the edges of the city a king holds court;<br>
Quietly presiding over the clover grown and wooded ruins of his keep.<br>
It was with the freedom of a lonely youth with time to unravel<br>
When I first came to parley with the king of spinney castle.</p>

<p>A muddy moat dissuades the incurious from the spinney's well-guarded secrets,<br>
And deep-rooted trees harken an unfelled palisade that holds back the surrounding suburbs.<br>
With school children on paper rounds and mobile library vans the present lays siege daily,<br>
But buses always turn about in deference to that bailey.</p>

<p>Cyclists in the park dismount and morning papers arrive prematurely<br>
Paid for in Christmas tips, wax candles, and memories of who lived here in passing.<br>
Sheltered homes and dovecote dwellings for departing widowed vassals<br>
Lie up against the garden wall between the hall and castle.</p>

<p>It's been many years now since I last visited the spinney<br>
And sought an audience amongst that court of rabbits and trees and crisp packets,<br>
But I'm certain a king still resides in that forgotten copse of pity;<br>
Long may he reign upon the hill that overlooks the city.</p>

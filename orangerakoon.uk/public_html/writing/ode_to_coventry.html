<h1>Ode to Coventry</h1>
<i>2020</i>

<p>This two-tone city of sky blue thinkers,<br>
Watchmakers, weavers, bicycle tinkers,<br>
Spon Street drinkers with elephant livers<br>
Who built a canal but buried a river -<br>
Which one of them drank up that idea?<br>
True blue batch eating beer imbibers;<br>
They keep alive the spirit of Godiva.<br>
Churchill's sold-out blitz survivors<br>
Built themselves back up from rubble -<br>
Now elephants live in this concrete jungle,<br>
Never forgetting what this city sacrificed.<br>
Those aren't pests they're pigeons of paradise<br>
Living in the landlocked heart of a nation;<br>
A brutalist city of reconciliation;<br>
A three spired twin city inspiration.<br>
If roads are arteries we're at the centre;<br>
We built the cars those roads were meant for<br>
Driving around our concrete ring road.<br>
Once these were walls of a roundhead stronghold;<br>
Now we welcome all to our bombed-out chapel.<br>
Nativity films and a Christmas carol<br>
Treasured by a people nonsectarian;<br>
Theatre performers and city librarians.<br>
Humanitarians, students, nurses,<br>
We're merciful Mercian charity workers.<br>
Labour electing champions of poverty -<br>
We're all proud that we came from Coventry.</p>

<h1>A Writer's Curse</h1>
<i>2019</i>

<p>While all good authors want to find<br>
A universe within the mind,<br>
I only offer this short verse<br>
Explaining of the writer's curse.</p>

<p>With pen in hand and tale to tell,<br>
An empty page near stops me dead;<br>
Confounded by all those who dwell<br>
Within the story in my head.</p>

<p>They've built a wall to keep me out;<br>
The world beyond removed from sight.<br>
A mystery behind the shroud<br>
With history I cannot write.</p>

<p>The page is blank, my efforts meek;<br>
That wall remains a hopeless climb.<br>
The source of my malaise I seek<br>
Forever further back in time</p>

<p>Until I finally see at last<br>
The force behind my fiction's strife;<br>
A dragon from the mythic past,<br>
The first idea brought to life.</p>

<p>Discerning his imagined state<br>
He rages at this author's hand<br>
And wages war against his fate<br>
Across all of my fictive land.</p>

<p>The creature roars, my writing slows,<br>
The story ends in faltering prose.<br>
Upon my mind descends a fog;<br>
A dragon's spell of writer's block.</p>

<h1>When One Word Is Written</h1>
<i>2019</i>

<p>When one word is written but you read it as another,<br>
Sat between the pages bounded by the cover,<br>
There lives the book imp, a creature like no other.</p>

<p>She delights in deception of the unwary reader,<br>
Hiding between the lines where the eye cannot see her;<br>
A literally invisible literary deceiver.</p>

<p>As the author's meaning is made uncertain<br>
The literate cede to the imp's coercion.<br>
The considerate see too the ink's inertion</p>

<p>And curse their failure in comprehension,<br>
Unknowing of the fairy's unwanted attention.<br>
Unfairly made to reread the lines before them,</p>

<p>All the while confounded by the imp's interference.<br>
Even when you think to avoid her appearance,<br>
Never doubt that creature's perseverance.</p>

<p>Even now these words betray,<br>
She tricks, she fools, she leads ashtray.<br>
Although you may suspect fowl play,</p>

<p>It is not I who misconstrues<br>
This poem and the words I use.<br>
Rather blame an impish ruse</p>

<p>When one word is mitten, but you read it as a mother.</p>
